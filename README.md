# Network-Intrusion-Detection
A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) detects unauthorized access and malicious content by continuously monitoring both inbound and outbound network traffic. It analyzes this traffic for changes in activity and patterns, recognizing attack signatures within network packets. Upon detecting unusual activity, the NIDS alerts administrators to the potential threat, enabling them to take immediate actions to remove it. By leveraging advanced pattern recognition and behavioral analysis, NIDS ensures timely detection and response to security threats, enhancing the overall security and integrity of the network.

The increasing sophistication and frequency of cyber threats pose significant challenges to network security, highlighting the need for more effective detection mechanisms. Traditional measures often fall short in identifying and mitigating these advanced threats. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) help by continuously monitoring network traffic for unauthorized access and malicious content. However, their efficacy is compromised by the vast volume and speed of modern network traffic, the need to adapt to evolving threats, and the difficulty in reducing false positives and false negatives. Complex attack patterns can also evade simple detection methods. Thus, enhancing NIDS with advanced pattern recognition and behavioral analysis is crucial for ensuring timely threat detection and response, ultimately improving network security and integrity.

We use machine learning in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) because it enhances their capability to accurately and efficiently detect sophisticated and evolving cyber threats. Machine learning models can analyze complex patterns and behaviors in network traffic, improving detection accuracy and reducing false positives and negatives. They adapt to new threats by learning from ongoing data, ensuring the system remains effective against emerging attack techniques. Additionally, machine learning handles large volumes of data in real-time, enabling timely detection and response to security threats, thereby bolstering the overall security and integrity of the network.

The columns that are used in the dataset represent features derived from network packets. These features summarize various aspects of network traffic and connection behaviors, which are utilized in machine learning models to detect intrusions and classify network connections as either normal or malicious.
